    <h1>Web Application Programming and Hacking</h1>
    <h2>Front-end Web Development Individual Project</h2>
    <h3>Instructor: Dr. Phu Phung</h3>
    <h3>Student: Gali Sai Divakar Reddy</h3>
    <hr>
    <h4>Course Overview</h4>
    <p>Throughout this course, we will delve into the fundamentals of web application development, covering key front-end technologies including HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, alongside back-end essentials like PHP and MySQL. The curriculum will include in-depth exploration of web application vulnerabilities and attacks through practical, hands-on exercises. Emphasis will also be placed on introducing secure programming principles and practices to proactively mitigate potential web application vulnerabilities and thwart malicious attacks.</p>

    <h4>Lab1 Overview:</h4>
    <p>In Lab 1, we will delve into the intricacies of the HTTP protocol and web application programming through a two-part exploration. Part I focuses on gaining familiarity with Wireshark for HTTP traffic analysis and using telnet to interact with HTTP servers hands-on. The objective is to understand HTTP components, methods, and responses. In Part II, the focus shifts to web application programming, introducing the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) and implementing a simple web application in C, featuring user input processing. Additionally, we will explore web application programming using PHP, emphasizing the distinctions between HTTP GET and POST requests and the associated security considerations. This comprehensive lab aims to provide us with a practical understanding of HTTP, CGI, and basic web application development.</p>

    <h4>Lab 2 Overview:</h4>
    <p>In the Lab2 front-end web development we need to complete two tasks. In Task 1, the focus will be on understanding basic HTML tags and forms. Following this, we will explore JavaScript and various methods of including JavaScript in an HTML file. Task 2 will delve into AJAX, CSS, jQuery, and the integration of web APIs using public APIs, providing hands-on experience with front-end web development concepts.</p>

    <h4>Hackathon 1 Overview:</h4>
    <p>This hackathon focuses on raising awareness about XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks. Participants learn about the vulnerabilities present in code, follow OWASP guidelines, and implement secure coding practices to defend against XSS attacks. The lab consists of two tasks. In Task 1, participants attack the URL <a href="http://waph-hackathon.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/xss/">http://waph-hackathon.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/xss/</a>, which has six levels of vulnerability to XSS attacks. Task 2 involves mitigating XSS attacks by implementing secure coding practices such as input validation and output sanitization.</p>

    <h4>project 1 Overview:</h4>
    <p>In this project, we will expand front-end web development skills by developing a Professional Profile Website and deploying it on github.io cloud service. This project has general, non-technical, and technical requirements.</p>
